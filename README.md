## What is MONICA?

**MONICA** stands for the **M**onitoring and **O**ptimization of **N**etwork **I**nfrastructures, **C**ommunications and **A**pplications.

The main objective of MONICA is the development of network traffic flow measurement and monitoring tools that are in conformity with the IPFIX protocol.

## What is IPFIX?

[IPFIX](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ipfix/about/) is the official IETF internet standard for the export of information about IP flows. It is a widely recognised and accepted protocol. It can provide a full representation of all individual connections that travel through an observation point (e.g. switch, router, firewall, etc.).

## What is an IP Flow?

IP flow or flow-level information refers to a set of packets sharing a common key that pass an observation point during a certain period of time. This flow key is usually defined by a five-tuple. The most commonly used flow key for flow creation is composed of the *source* and *destination IP addresses*, *source* and *destination ports*, and *protocol identifier*.
