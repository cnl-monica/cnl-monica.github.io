## What is MONICA?

**MONICA** stands for the **M**onitoring and **O**ptimization of **N**etwork **I**nfrastructures, **C**ommunications and **A**pplications.

The main objective of MONICA is the development of network traffic flow measurement and monitoring tools that are in conformity with the IPFIX protocol.

## What is IPFIX?

[IPFIX](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ipfix/about/) is the official IETF internet standard for the export of information about IP flows. It is a widely recognised and accepted protocol. It can provide a full representation of all individual connections that travel through an observation point (e.g. switch, router, firewall, etc.).

## What is an IP Flow?

IP flow or flow-level information refers to a set of packets sharing a common key that pass an observation point during a certain period of time. This flow key is usually defined by a five-tuple. The most commonly used flow key for flow creation is composed of the *source* and *destination IP addresses*, *source* and *destination ports*, and *protocol identifier*. If an observed packet differs from the other packets in at least one property, it belongs to another flow.

## What are the main components of an IPFIX-based measurement and monitoring platform?

Network management related activities such as traffic engineering and classification, monitoring, accounting and profiling, or intrusion detection and prevention, are based on the analysis of the exported traffic information. The general architecture of an IPFIX-based measurement and monitoring platform is as follows:

</p>

Traffic information is carried in *flow records*. The export of flow records represents a push-based mechanism, where the data are transmitted from the *IPFIX exporter(s)* to the *IPFIX collector(s)* over either TCP, UPD or the SCTP. The essential components of any IPFIX-based measurement platform are therefore the exporters and the collectors.

### Exporter

The architecture of the exporter is as follows:

  <img src="/fig/exporter.png" width="410" title="Architecture of the exporter" />
</p>

The exporter is a device which hosts one or more exporting processes. Each exporter sends flow records to one or more collectors.
The flow records are generated by one or more metering processes. The metering process consists of a set of functions including packet capture, timestamping, packet selection (sampling and filtering), classification and maintaining (creating) flow records in the flow cache. A layer higher is the exporting process. It provides an interface between the metering process(es) and the collecting process(es), i.e. it sends (exports) the flow records obtained from the metering process(es) to one or more collectors. Its further functional block is flow selection (sampling or filtering) that can provide additional data reduction.

### Collector

The collector is a device which hosts a collecting process. The collecting process receives flow records from one or more exporting processes. The main goal of the collector is to extract the measured properties and features of the flows from the flow records. For efficiency, this information is stored and carried in Information Elements.

IPFIX protocol defines how the flow records are exported to the collector(s). In practice, they are transmitted by two ”containers”: templates and data. Flow records are carried in data records and the structure of these data records is defined by the templates. It follows from the fact, that traffic information depends on the purpose of the measurement and the network structure.
